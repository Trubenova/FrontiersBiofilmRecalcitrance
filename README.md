# Modeling polygenic antibiotic resistance evolution in biofilms

## Introduction
This code was used to perform simulations and to generate results and figures published in article:  Modeling polygenic antibiotic resistance evolution in biofilms. 
It contains main file with classed defining populations (planktonic or biofilm) and experiments functions: biofilm_function.py. This file needs to be loaded by jupyter notebooks in order to perform the simulations. 


## File description
Jupyter notebooks contain the code used to parametrize the simulations to simulate various experiments: 

### IllustrationOfEffects.ipynb

This Jupyter notebook contains code to simulate single treatment at given concentration, starting with mixed population (50:50 wt to mutant). Results of these simulations are shown in Figure 5. 
Note that a change of the name and concentration is required to simulate various scenarios (different panels of figure 5). 

### EvolutinaryExperiment_passages.ipynb
Code in this Jupyter notebook is used to simulate a passage experiment.  Results of these simulations are shown in Figure 5. 

### Zip files

Zip files contain either figures (Figures.zip) or simulation results used to generate these figures.
