# Modeling polygenic antibiotic resistance evolution in biofilms


## Table of contents

## Introduction
This code was used to perform simulations and to generate results and figures published in article:  Modeling polygenic antibiotic resistance evolution in biofilms. 
It contains main file with classed defining populations (planktonic or biofilm) and experiments functions: biofilm_function.py. This file needs to be loaded by jupyter notebooks in order to perform the simulations. 


## File description
Jupyter notebooks contain the code used to parametrize the simulations to simulate various experiments: 



Zip files contain either figures (Figures.zip) or simulation results used to generate these figures.
